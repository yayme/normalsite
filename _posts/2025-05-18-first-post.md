## The Two Envelope Paradox

Youâ€™re handed two sealed envelopes.  
One has **twice** as much money as the other. You pick one. Letâ€™s say it has \$X.

Now comes the twisty part:  
> "Should you switch?"

You reason:  
- There's a 50% chance the other envelope has \$2X  
- A 50% chance it has \$X/2  
- Expected value = (0.5 Ã— 2X) + (0.5 Ã— X/2) = **1.25X**

Whoa, more money? Always switch!

But waitâ€”if that logic works no matter which envelope you pickâ€¦  
shouldnâ€™t you just **keep switching forever**?

ðŸŒ€ Paradox activated.

## Whatâ€™s going on?

The problem hides in the assumption. You can't just assign fixed probabilities to **X** without knowing the **distribution** of the amounts inside. You're mixing up fixed values and variables.

It **feels** like free money, but without knowing how the envelopes were filled, the expected value math breaks down.

In short:  
> Infinite switching? Bad idea. Stick to your first loveâ€”uh, envelope.
