I'm Adnan Sadik, a mathematics student at KAIST who specializes in solving complex problems through statistical and computational methods. Currently pursuing applied mathematics with a focus on developing analytical solutions for financial and biomedical applications.

My academic work spans statistical modeling, quantitative analysis, and computational techniques, with hands-on research experience in labs working on sleep disorder classification and language model evaluation for low-resource languages.

## Academic Focus

I specialize in the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and computational methods:

- **Statistical Learning** - Advanced statistical modeling and inference
- **Quantitative Finance** - Mathematical finance and risk modeling  
- **Computational Mathematics** - Algorithm development and predictive modeling

## Research Experience

Currently conducting research at:
- **IBS Biomedical Mathematics Group** - Computational pipelines for medical classification
- **KAIST Users & Information Lab** - Cultural benchmark datasets for language evaluation
- **KAIST Data Strategy Lab** - Financial modeling and computational analysis

My work combines theoretical foundations with practical applications, contributing to publications and developing solutions that bridge academic research with real-world impact.
