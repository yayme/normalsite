subtitle: A quick introduction
---

My name is Adnan Sadik. I'm someone who enjoys solving complex problems, collaborating with driven individuals, and engaging in strategic thinking—whether in professional settings or over a good game of Chess, Avalon, or Poker.

I'm passionate about meaningful work, especially when it involves creativity, logic, and collaboration. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring mystery fiction—both in literature and film—as a way to unwind and spark curiosity.

### Academic Interests

My academic interests lie at the intersection of mathematics, data, and decision-making. I am particularly focused on:

- **Statistical Learning**
- **Quantitative Finance**
- **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**

These areas excite me for their blend of theory and real-world impact, and I am always eager to explore new developments and practical applications in each.

### My Story

Originally from a small town, my journey has taken me through diverse challenges and opportunities, eventually leading me to KAIST. Along the way, I've grown to value resilience, clarity of thought, and the importance of asking the right questions. Every step forward has been driven by a desire to learn, adapt, and contribute.
