## Projects

### *Currently working on*: 
### Volatility Inference with Stochastic Differential Equations and Data assimilation:
...
### SignalCraft: Crypto Alpha Discovery System  
*Python, Quant Research, Backtesting* – [GitHub](https://github.com/yayme/Crypto-SignalCraft)  
Developed a modular pipeline to identify and backtest predictive signals from crypto spot data.  
Achieved ~52% hit rate and Sharpe ratio > 1 using ensemble models and adaptive trading strategies.

### Real-time Sarcasm Detector  
*Python, PyTorch, NLP* – [GitHub](https://github.com/yayme/Bazinga-)  
Built a BERT-based sarcasm classifier with Hugging Face and TweetEval for real-time inference.

### AI-powered File Organizer  
*Python, AI/ML* – [GitHub](https://github.com/yayme/Desktop_file_organizer)  
Created a real-time file sorter using NLP and vector similarity to classify content-based documents.

### Bayesian Filtering and Data Assimilation with Python  
*Python* – [GitHub](https://github.com/yayme/Data-Assimilation)  
Implemented Kalman and Particle Filters for state estimation in noisy time-series environments.

### Statistical Decision Making - Class Project  
*Python* – [GitHub](https://github.com/yayme/Statistical-Decision-Making)  
Used Bayesian inference and classification to optimize inventory and healthcare decision models.

### Yut AI - Korean Traditional Board Game AI
*Python, Game Theory, Bayesian Optimization* – [GitHub](https://github.com/yayme/COE-Yutnori)
Developed intelligent agents for Yut, a traditional Korean board game competition. Tested minimax tree search and heuristic-based strategies. Final approach used heuristic evaluation with Bayesian optimization (Gaussian Process + UCB) for weight tuning across game phases, distance evaluation, and capture threat assessment. Consistently outperforms baseline strategy with 54-56% win rate.
